    abstract = {The problem of change point detection can be solved either by online methods, based on a discrepancy measure, or by offline methods. The former tries to detect the change points one by one with a sliding window and leads to a lower computational time but are more sensitive to noise. Conversely, offline methods consider the entire data to detect all the change points which make them more robust against the noise but at a price of higher computational cost. In this paper, we propose an operational search method that combines the benefits of both approaches with the double aim to get higher noise resistance while keeping a blazingly fast time. The search method slides over the edges of the signal to determines their state by considering a global constrained energy. Thanks to the calculus of variation, the computation of this energy is reduced to the estimation of the effective jump for each edge. We study the performance and accuracy of our energy variation method to detect the change points in synthetic and real-world examples. The results compare favorably against state of the art algorithm in terms of speed and accuracy.}

This problem is central to several applications such as human activity analysis, speech or image analysis, and anomaly detection in genetics. We present a two-stage approach to minimize the well-known line process model which arises from the probabilistic representation of the signal and its segmentation. In the first stage, we minimize a TV least square problem to detect the majority of the continuous edges. In the second stage, we apply a combinatorial algorithm to filter all false jumps introduced by the TV solution. The performances of the proposed method were tested on several synthetic examples. In comparison to recent step-preserving denoising algorithms, the acceleration presents a superior speed and competitive step-detection quality.}

	abstract= {In this paper, we are interested in restoring piecewise constant
	        signals obtained from a linear operator A (e.g. a blurring operator)
	        and degraded by a white Gaussian noise. The number of plateaus and
	        their values are unknown. So the problem could be tackled as a joint
	        restoration and unsupervised segmentation in the context of linear
	        inverse problems. The DPS algorithm is a combinatorial algorithm
	        proposed to solve the classical case, where the linear operator is
	        reduced to I. The solution is computed as a global minimizer of an
	        energy function that contains a quadratic fidelity term and a
	        non-convex pairwise potential term. DPS offers a faster alternative
	        to the GNC algorithm that minimizes the same energy in a
	        continuation deterministic approach. We present an extension to the
	        DPS algorithm for the general case. This extension only requires the
	        regularity of the matrix , unlike the GNC extension that needs
	        further computation of its smallest eigenvalue in order to formulate
	        a convex relaxation. Also, we present a message passing and shared
	        memory implementation to speed up the running time for high
	        dimension signals. The parallelization is possible since DPS
	        evaluate the energy on a set of nodes in a given hypercube, and in
	        each level of the hypercube, the nodes are independents.},

	abstract = { A robust estimator, namely the DPS algorithm, for piecewise constant signals denoising, is revised in this paper. Starting from its Markov random field formulation, which defines the solution as the global minimizer of a non-convex non-smooth energy function. The DPS algorithm transforms the line process mixed energy into a discrete optimization problem and proposes a BFS search strategy to find the optimal state. We develop a numerical scheme to replace the BFS search by a simple linear scan over the edges of the MRF. Each visit to an edge considers a local blanket of the MRF and then computes the estimated signal around the vicinity of the edge. The gradient of the solution will decide the existence or absence of a discontinuity based on a threshold. Theoretical results shows that the new implementation has a linear time and space complexity, but the local aspect reduces the robustness of the method against noise. A set of numerical simulations assist to show the reduction in time compared to the classical implementation and to compare the restoration quality against state-of-the-art algorithms.}

	         scientific areas. Several denoising algorithms exist such as total
	         variation, convex relaxation, Markov random fields models, etc. The
	         DPS algorithm is a combinatorial algorithm that excels the
	         classical GNC in term of speed and SNR resistance. However, its
	         running time slows down considerably for large signals. The main
	         reason for this bottleneck is the size and the number of linear
	         systems that need to be solved. We develop a recursive
	         implementation of the DPS algorithm that uses the conditional
	         independence, created by a confirmed discontinuity between two
	         parts, to separate the reconstruction process of each part.
	         Additionally, we propose an accelerated Cholesky solver which
	         reduces the computational cost and memory usage. We evaluate the

	         compare the quality of our solver. The results show a significant
