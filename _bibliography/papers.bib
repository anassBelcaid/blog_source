	abstract ={In this paper, we focus on the problem of change point detection
	        in piecewise constant signals. This problem is central to several
	        applications such as human activity analysis, speech or image
	        analysis and anomaly detection in genetics. We present a novel
	        window-sliding algorithm for an online change point detection. The
	        proposed approach considers a local blanket of a global Markov
	        Random Field (MRF) representing the signal and its noisy
	        observation. For each window, we define and solve the local energy
	        minimization problem to deduce the gradient on each edge of the MRF
	        graph. The gradient is then processed by an activation function to
	        filter the weak features and produce the final jumps. We demonstrate
	        the effectiveness of our method by comparing its running time and
	        several detection metrics with state of the art algorithms. },

	abstract= {In this paper, we are interested in restoring piecewise constant
	        signals obtained from a linear operator A (e.g. a blurring operator)
	        and degraded by a white Gaussian noise. The number of plateaus and
	        their values are unknown. So the problem could be tackled as a joint
	        restoration and unsupervised segmentation in the context of linear
	        inverse problems. The DPS algorithm is a combinatorial algorithm
	        proposed to solve the classical case, where the linear operator is
	        reduced to I. The solution is computed as a global minimizer of an
	        energy function that contains a quadratic fidelity term and a
	        non-convex pairwise potential term. DPS offers a faster alternative
	        to the GNC algorithm that minimizes the same energy in a
	        continuation deterministic approach. We present an extension to the
	        DPS algorithm for the general case. This extension only requires the
	        regularity of the matrix , unlike the GNC extension that needs
	        further computation of its smallest eigenvalue in order to formulate
	        a convex relaxation. Also, we present a message passing and shared
	        memory implementation to speed up the running time for high
	        dimension signals. The parallelization is possible since DPS
	        evaluate the energy on a set of nodes in a given hypercube, and in
	        each level of the hypercube, the nodes are independents.},

	abstract = { A robust estimator, namely the DPS algorithm, for piecewise constant signals denoising, is revised in this paper. Starting from its Markov random field formulation, which defines the solution as the global minimizer of a non-convex non-smooth energy function. The DPS algorithm transforms the line process mixed energy into a discrete optimization problem and proposes a BFS search strategy to find the optimal state. We develop a numerical scheme to replace the BFS search by a simple linear scan over the edges of the MRF. Each visit to an edge considers a local blanket of the MRF and then computes the estimated signal around the vicinity of the edge. The gradient of the solution will decide the existence or absence of a discontinuity based on a threshold. Theoretical results shows that the new implementation has a linear time and space complexity, but the local aspect reduces the robustness of the method against noise. A set of numerical simulations assist to show the reduction in time compared to the classical implementation and to compare the restoration quality against state-of-the-art algorithms.}
