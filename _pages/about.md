I'm an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science associate Professor at `National School of Applied Sciences - Safi`. Prior to that I was an associate Professor in the `School of Digital Engineering and Artificial Intelligence` at the   **Euromed** university. I finished my PhD in 2018 at `ENSAM` School in the laboratory of Professor `M.Douimi`. I got my master's degree in **grid computing and asynchronous algorithms** at Faculty of Science Mekn√®s.

## Research Interests



I'm currently working on `edge detection` in computer vision using a combination
of convolution  networks and Residual Dense networks.

I'm also starting a new project to investigate maximum entropy methods in
`reinforcement learning` and their combination with hierarchical models using
complex architecture than the **actor/critic**.
