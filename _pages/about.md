I'm an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science associate Professor at `Digital Engieenering and Artificial Intelligence School` at the `Euromed` university. Prior to coming to **Euromed**, in 2020-2021, I was a part time professor at `ENSAM` School at Meknès. I finished my PhD in 2018 at `ENSAM` School in the laboratory of Professor `M.Douimi`. I got my master's degree in **grid computing and asynchronous algorithms** at Faculty of Science Meknès. More information are on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/cv.pdf"> Personal curriculum </a>

## Research Interests



I'm currently working on `edge detection` in computer vision using a combination
of convolution  networks and Residual Dense networks.

I'm also starting a new project to investigate maximum entropy methods in
`reinforcement learning` and their combination with hierarchical models using
complex architecture than the **actor/critic**.
